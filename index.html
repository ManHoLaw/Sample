                How to make a cup of tea.
            </h2>
            <p>
                1. Fill a kettle or small saucepan with fresh, cold water. The amount of water should be enough to fill your desired cup or mug.
                2. Place the kettle/saucepan on the stove and turn the heat to high. Bring the water to a full rolling boil.
                3. While the water is heating, place a tea bag or loose tea leaves in your cup or mug.
                4. Once the water is boiling, carefully pour it over the tea. Fill the cup to the top.
                5. Allow the tea to steep for 3-5 minutes. The longer you steep it, the stronger the tea flavor will be.
                6. Remove the tea bag or strain out the loose leaves if using.
                7. Add any desired sweeteners, milk, or lemon at this point.
                8. Enjoy your freshly brewed cup of hot tea!
